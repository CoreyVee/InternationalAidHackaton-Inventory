# Unlocking Communities Inventory

-----
## About

### The Problem
The non-profit Unlocking Communities facilitates the sale and distribution of vital water filtration systems and clean-burning stoves in under-developed regions of the world. To do this they currently rely on expensive licensed software. In order to divert more of their resources to their core mission, they are looking to replace this software with a proprietary application that is better suited to their specific needs.

### The Solution
This is a React Native application built for use in low-connectivity parts of the world to support the needs of local community managers in underdeveloped regions who sell water filtration systems and clean-burning stoves. This application supports local managers and salespeople in management of paper and digital contracts, and in management of inventory flow.

### User Stories
Our primary users are community managers who work closely with salespeople in their local community. They want to be able to:
- log in to their user account
- view inventory in their community
- edit/delete inventory in their community
- add inventory in their community
- input contract information
- have contract information automatically update inventory numbers
- (stretch goal) sync information when online for offline use
- (stretch goal) scan and store paper sales contracts digitally
